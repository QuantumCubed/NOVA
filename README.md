# NOVA

## Problem & Solution
Local and niche content often gets overshadowed by mainstream media and large platforms, making it difficult for unique cultural and community perspectives to be heard. Nova addresses this by offering a space where users can upload and share content that highlights local cultures, issues, and communities. This fosters diversity and inclusion, giving a platform to voices and stories that might otherwise remain unheard.

## User Experience
Nova is a web streaming service that empowers users to share their videos and engage with the community. Users can build a following through interactive features like comments, likes, dislikes, and subscriptions. The design and use cases are demonstrated in the prototype video.
