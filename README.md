# NOVA

## Problem & Solution

Local and niche content is often overshadowed by mainstream media & pre-existing dominant services, limiting the exposure of unique cultural and community perspectives.
The application allows users to upload and share content that reflects local cultures, issues, and communities. This promotes greater diversity and inclusion, giving a platform to voices and stories that might otherwise go unnoticed.

## User Experience

Nova is a web streaming service that allows users to upload videos and share them with the community. They can build a following and comment, like, dislike, and subscribe. More detail of the design elements is in the prototype video.
